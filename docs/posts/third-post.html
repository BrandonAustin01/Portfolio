      <h1>🎬 <em>A Working Man</em> — A Gritty Ride with Familiar Punches</h1>
<p>There’s something about a Jason Statham movie that just <strong>hits the spot</strong> for me.<br>Maybe I’m biased — I’ve been a fan for as long as I can remember — but <em>A Working Man</em> delivered exactly what I came for: grit, action, and that quiet intensity Statham does better than almost anyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>David Harbour</strong> sharing the screen was a bonus. That guy brings a weight to every role he takes.<br>Together they added a solid dynamic — two heavy hitters with very different energies that somehow meshed well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>✅ What I Loved</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jason Statham</strong> leading the charge — classic, grounded, and sharp as ever  </li>
<li><strong>David Harbour</strong> bringing his presence  </li>
<li><strong>The pacing, tone, and edge</strong> — it kept me engaged from start to finish</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>⚠️ What Gave Me Pause</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It definitely gave off <em>Taken</em> vibes.<br>A little <em>too</em> close in some scenes — like it was chasing the same formula beat for beat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of the <strong>fight scenes flirted with the edge of believability</strong> — a bit too choreographed, a bit too clean.<br>But you know what? I still enjoyed every hit, every slam, every slow-mo moment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🎯 Final Take</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>A Working Man</em> gave me what I wanted:<br>A rough-and-tumble ride with actors I admire.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>not trying to reinvent the genre</strong> — and maybe that’s okay.<br>Sometimes you just want to watch Jason Statham wreck a room and walk out with barely a scratch.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Would I recommend it?</strong><br>Absolutely — especially if you&#39;re already a fan of the genre, or of the cast.<br>Just don’t expect it to break new ground.<br>Expect it to <em>work</em>, and it does.</p>
