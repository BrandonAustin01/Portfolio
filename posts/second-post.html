      <h1>🧠 Wednesday — Your Local AI Assistant</h1>
<p>Ever wish you had your own <strong>Jarvis</strong>, but like... privacy-focused, offline-capable, and born from blood, sweat, and Python?<br>Meet <strong>Wednesday</strong> — the AI assistant that thinks <em>before</em> she speaks. And logs it. 📓🖤</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧬 What Is Wednesday?</h2>
<p>Wednesday is not just another “Hey Google” clone. She’s a <strong>modular voice-first assistant</strong> built to run <strong>locally</strong>, talk smart, and never snitch.<br>Think of her as a cross between:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧑‍💻 A bash terminal that went to finishing school  </li>
<li>🔐 A therapist who <em>logs your trauma</em> but doesn’t sell it to advertisers  </li>
<li>🤖 And a GPT-powered friend who <em>actually listens</em> (unless your mic breaks, then she politely switches to CLI mode)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🔧 Tech Vibes</h2>
<ul>
<li>🎤 Wake word detection so she only talks when called (👋 <em>“Yo Wednesday”</em>)  </li>
<li>💬 Full GPT-4 command handling — ask her anything from “what’s the weather” to “summarize the Roman Empire”  </li>
<li>🗣️ Voice input/output with auto fallback to CLI if your mic is being a diva  </li>
<li>🧱 Modular structure for easy plugin development (because why not give her weather, jokes, and app-launching superpowers?)  </li>
<li>🧩 Built-in command processor with <code>handle_command()</code> — like a Swiss army knife but way nerdier  </li>
<li>🧼 Logs everything to separate files so you can trace issues like a paranoid genius  </li>
<li>🔒 Your data <em>stays local</em>. Always. No creepy cloud syncing here.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🎯 The Mission</h2>
<p><strong>Wednesday was made for devs, dreamers, and doers.</strong><br>She&#39;s meant to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Extensible</strong> – Want her to control your smart lights? Add it.  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>Private</strong> – Local logs, local keys, local voice.  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>Resilient</strong> – Mic not working? No sweat, she’ll slide into text mode without missing a beat.  </li>
<li>✅ <strong>Friendly</strong> – With built-in humor, easter eggs, and the emotional stability of a bot who’s seen things.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Real Use Case?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wednesday, summarize my last meeting.”<br>“Wednesday, launch VS Code.”<br>“Wednesday, give me the changelog since 0.3.7.”<br>“Wednesday, switch to voice-only mode.”<br>“Wednesday, why am I like this?” 🤔 (She’s still working on that one.)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>😂 Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>🐞 She logs bugs better than half the people on your dev team.  </li>
<li>💤 She’ll fall back to CLI if you ghost her too long (silent timeout FTW).  </li>
<li>🔄 She <em>rearms herself</em> after each wake word like a loyal sentry.  </li>
<li>🧠 She’s trained on GPT but wired for silence — no call home, no data leaks, no drama.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🚀 Where It’s Going</h2>
<p>Wednesday is growing up fast:<br>Next steps include GUI dashboards, smarter logging summaries, emotion-aware interactions (maybe), and release mode toggling for dev vs. user modes.<br>And yes — she&#39;ll keep her goth name.</p>
<hr>
<h2>💭 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Wednesday isn’t just a project.<br>She’s a <em>movement</em> — a reminder that AI can be useful <strong>without</strong> being creepy.<br>A voice assistant that works <em>with</em> you, not <em>on</em> you.<br>And one day, she’ll be the reason your coffee machine brews before your eyes open. ☕✨</p>

<p>❤️ Wednesday thinks before she speaks. And when she speaks, she logs it</p>
