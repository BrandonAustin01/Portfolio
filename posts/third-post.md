# 🎬 *A Working Man* — A Gritty Ride with Familiar Punches

There’s something about a Jason Statham movie that just **hits the spot** for me.  
Maybe I’m biased — I’ve been a fan for as long as I can remember — but *A Working Man* delivered exactly what I came for: grit, action, and that quiet intensity Statham does better than almost anyone.

> **David Harbour** sharing the screen was a bonus. That guy brings a weight to every role he takes.  
> Together they added a solid dynamic — two heavy hitters with very different energies that somehow meshed well.

## ✅ What I Loved

- **Jason Statham** leading the charge — classic, grounded, and sharp as ever  
- **David Harbour** bringing his presence  
- **The pacing, tone, and edge** — it kept me engaged from start to finish  

---

## ⚠️ What Gave Me Pause

- It definitely gave off *Taken* vibes.  
  A little *too* close in some scenes — like it was chasing the same formula beat for beat.

- Some of the **fight scenes flirted with the edge of believability** — a bit too choreographed, a bit too clean.  
  But you know what? I still enjoyed every hit, every slam, every slow-mo moment.

## 🎯 Final Take

At the end of the day, *A Working Man* gave me what I wanted:  
A rough-and-tumble ride with actors I admire.

It’s **not trying to reinvent the genre** — and maybe that’s okay.  
Sometimes you just want to watch Jason Statham wreck a room and walk out with barely a scratch.

**Would I recommend it?**  
Absolutely — especially if you're already a fan of the genre, or of the cast.  
Just don’t expect it to break new ground.  
Expect it to *work*, and it does.
